**agamotto** is a Flask + React app for managing your Wheel options trading strategy. Like the MCU's [Eye of Agamotto](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Agamotto), it allows you, the bold trader, to harness the power of ~~theta~~ time.

> **Note:** Code for the alpha version of **agamotto** will be released in due time.

## Motivation
There aren't many free or open-source trading journals for options out there. And there are even fewer that implement my specific variant of the Wheel strategy, in terms of the metrics and rules I use. With no tool that meets my full set of  unique needs, the only *option* was to develop one from scratch.

## Installation and Usage
See the [documentation](https://chrischow.github.io/agamotto/getting_started) for the detailed instructions.

## Features
**agamotto** enables you to:

- Scan for put options to initiate a Wheel strategy
- Log put/call options and stock trades
- Monitor your open options trades, with recommendations to buyback or roll
- Get a high-level overview of your profits, broken down by strategy, ticker, and trade

This is just a high-level description. See the [documentation](https://chrischow.github.io/agamotto/user_guide) for a full walkthrough of the app.

## Background on agamotto
This is the 3rd iteration of **agamotto**. The first was an options scanner built in Streamlit. I could identify trades with relatively good risk-to-reward ratio. However, these tickers did not produce a strong performance during paper trading because the underlying companies were relatively small and unstable, hence the high premiums and underestimated risk metrics. As I refined my strategy, I refined my toolkit.

The second iteration of **agamotto** was a 100% Flask app. There was no frontend library/framework - I simply dumped JavaScript into the templates that required them. As I was new to JavaScript at the time, my code was not particularly elegant, and the code base was poorly organised.

This time, I'm re-building the project after learning and getting some practice in React. 

The second was a Flask-only app that used JavaScript on specific templates. 

## Future Work
- Deployment:
    - [ ] Push container to Docker Hub
    - [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for CI
    - [ ] Develop **agamotto** cloud
- Admin:
    - [ ] Consider [Flask-Dance](https://flask-dance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/multi-user.html) for OAuth
- Dashboard:
    - TBC
- Monitor:
    - TBC
- Manage:
    - [ ] Upload CSV function - needs validation of dataframe
- Scan:
    - [ ] Enable creation of presets
- Analyse:
    - TBC
- Documentation:
    - Re-factor docs to installation + deployment for different platforms
        - [ ] Google App Engine (using containers)
